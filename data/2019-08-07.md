# v0.9.0

## 🌟 New Features

- The presentation of the document title and the possibilities for editing it
  have been fundamentally revised. We call this new view the _document
  information view_. Currently, only the document title can be edited there. In
  the future, further information about the document (document metadata) will
  follow here, for example to be able to specify the author of a document.
- Bonsai Writer can now export documents as a PDF file (see section "Bonsai
  Writer plug-ins" below).
- The processing of block metadata, such as image titles, can now be confirmed
  simply by using the Return key. The cursor then jumps back to the main text
  area.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- If text is copied from the beginning of a list item and pasted elsewhere, the
  inserted item is no longer nested by one layer too deep.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the menu to refer to a window other than the one
  in the foreground on macOS.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the context menu to refer to the text you
  selected in the main text area above an entry in the outline view.
- Merging a list and a subsequent heading using Backspace or Delete no longer
  results in a faulty state.
- Fixed a bug that could cause menus to not offer the expected entries after
  calling "Select All" in the main text area.
- If the app is used in English, it now correctly reffers to the English license
  conditions.
- Fixed a bug that could cause inserting an image into a list to not work
  correctly.

## 💅 User Interface / Design

Improved the presentation of the menu entries for theme selection.

## 🌻 Improvements

- The interaction of window menus and windows under Linux and Windows has been
  improved.
- Under Linux, BWT files are recognized as such. BWT files are now opened by
  default with Bonsai Writer.

## Bonsai Writer Plug-ins

Most eagerly awaited by many, finally here! 🎊 PDF export! 🎊

The PDF export is delivered as a separate component - as a _Bonsai Writer
plug-in_. If you haven't installed the plug-in yet, go to "Export as PDF." and
then confirm that you want to download and install the plug-in. In this first
version, the PDF export uses a fixed, professionally designed design. In later
versions you will get more flexibility. However, the quality of the export is
already world class. 🥇 - Convince yourself!

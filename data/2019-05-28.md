# v0.8.0

## 🌟 New Features

- The user can now decide whether Bonsai Writer should inform him about updates
  or not. He can control the behavior in the update dialog or anytime via the
  Help menu.
- When starting Bonsai Writer for the first time, the user is presented with
  some hints for working with Bonsai Writer. This should help new users to find
  their way around and to get to know the special interaction possibilities of
  Bonsai Writer.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

In the "unsaved changes" dialog, now the file name is used, if the document has
already been saved before.

## 💅 User Interface / Design

- The color design of the handles has been adapted so that they are now also
  visible on very bright adjusted monitors.
- A banner with the word "Alpha" is now visible in the upper right corner of the
  document window to show users that the software is an Alpha version.

## 🌻 Improvements

- The update notification now appears in the form of a dialog window.
- The menu item for the PDF export now presents a _Coming soon_ hint. The
  previous ( prototypical) PDF export has been removed and will soon be replaced
  by a much better, completely new implementation.

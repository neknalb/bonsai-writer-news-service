# v0.5.0

## 🌟 New Features

### Image

One of the most wanted features has now been implemented: With the new version
0.5.0 you can add pictures to your Bonsai Writer documents.

<!-- // SCREENSHOT: Bild im Dokument -->

You can use the structure menu in the menu bar or the context menu in the main
text area. Or you can copy an image from another program and paste it into your
document using the clipboard.

Pictures can be labelled with a title. To do this you use the Metadata view.

<!-- // SCREENSHOT: Bildtitel in Haupttextfeld und Metadatenansicht -->

JPEGs often contain rotation information, which Bonsai Writer evaluates
correctly so that the sky in your photos is at the top and the sea at the
bottom.

Currently, the image formats PNG, JPEG, GIF and BMP are supported. Even animated
images can be inserted as PNG or GIF. But beware! We haven't added a way to stop
them yet! 🤪

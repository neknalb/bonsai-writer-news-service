# v0.7.0

## 🌟 New Features

For list elements, the handle and structure menus now offer the possibility to
increase the list level along with its child elements. For the _first_ list
element of a list, you cannot increase the list level, as this would not be
useful.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- When opening a BWT file, the window title is no longer "Bonsai Writer",
  instead the file name is displayed.
- Copying and pasting after selecting the entire document no longer leads to an
  error.
- Changing the window height no longer causes the font to flicker.

## 💅 User Interface / Design

The colors in the outline view have been revised.

## 🌻 Improvements

- If an image is selected that is in a list, pressing Enter inserts a new list
  element into the list right after the image.
- If you click under an image that is at the end of the document, a new
  paragraph is created there.
- For failed exports (via plug-in) a message now appears, informing the user
  that the export failed.
- The help menu now contains an additional link to the license terms on the
  Bonsai Writer website. The entry to activate the developer tools has been
  removed.
- The context menu shows the options to change the text structure only when
  opened in the text area.

## Bonsai Writer Plug-ins

The plug-in interface has been extended by a call for the first setup
(initialization). A Bonsai Writer plug-in can therefore perform necessary steps
before the first use – e.g. loading required components.
